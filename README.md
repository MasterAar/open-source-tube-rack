# Open Source Tube Rack
![full tube rack main](images/full-tube-rack-iso.jpg)
## Description
An open source test tube rack design made for ~15mm to ~17.5mm diameter test tubes commonly used for coronavirus testing. This repository is meant to be a hub for source files, documentation, and improvements to be made. Refer to [Ordering Parts](#ordering-parts) and [Assembly](#assembly-instructions) for further instructions.

This design is meant to replace commonly used snap-together test tube racks like [these](https://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00ligULfpcqukB/Snap-Together-Test-Tube-Racks-with-90-Wells.jpg). Although this laser-cut acrylic design is larger than snap-together tube racks for similar size tubes, it has several key improvements:
* Uses a 96-well format, which interfaces better with other lab equipment and is a more common layout. <img src="images/empty-tube-rack-iso.jpg" alt="tube rack with engravings" width="450"/>
* Larger spacing between test tubes means they are easy to grab, even in the middle of the rack.
* Engraved row and column lettering helps with indexing the test tubes, and is much larger and easier to see than the tiny "embossed" lettering on common 60 or 90-place snap-together racks. <img src="images/empty-tube-rack-engravings.jpg" alt="tube rack with engravings" width="300"/>

## Ordering Parts
*Will be updated in the next few days with proper instructions and a bill of materials. If you need this immediately, reach out directly to [Aaron Beckman](https://github.com/MasterAar).*

## Assembly Instructions
Assembly is a time-consuming but straightforward process. The [assembly manual](assembly-manual.pdf) is the current source of instructions. Everything you should need to know about making these (including a list of helpful tools and tricks for making assembly faster) will be in there.
